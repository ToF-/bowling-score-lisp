# Introduction

Welcome to the Lisp Bowling Score Kata! 

In this little book, we learn how to code in Common Lisp applying Test Driven Development. 

We will be using the [Steel Bank Common Lisp](https://www/sbcl/org/) with as few external libraries as possible.

The Bowling Score Kata exercise is about writing a program that can compute a score at the Ten-pin Bowling, given a list of roll points make by a player.
