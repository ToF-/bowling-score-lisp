## The Game of Bowling

Here's a reminder of the rules of bowling ([source](https://bowlingforbeginners.com/bowling-rules/)):

- The ultimate goal is to knock down all ten pins on your first turn.
- During each frame, each player gets two attempts to knock down all ten pins.
- Turns are called “frames,” and each player plays ten frames in a game.
- Knocking down all the pins on your first throw is called a strike.
- If you miss at least one pin on the first throw and then knock down any remaining pins on your second throw, it’s called a spare.
- If a player bowls a strike in the tenth frame, they get two more throws within that frame. If they get a spare in the final frame, the player gets to throw one more ball.
- Open frames are simply frames that left at least one pin standing.
- Scoring is based on the number of pins knocked down. Except, when you get a spare, you get 10 plus the number of pins you knock down during your next throw. If you get a strike, you get 10 plus the number of pins you knock down with your next two throws.

Here's an example of score ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling)):
