# Introduction

Welcome to the Lisp Bowling Score Kata! 

In this little book, we learn how to code in Common Lisp applying Test Driven Development. 

We will be using the [Steel Bank Common Lisp](https://www/sbcl/org/) with as few external libraries as possible.

The Bowling Score Kata exercise is about writing a program that can compute scores at the Ten-Pin Bowling, given lists of rolls points made by players.
