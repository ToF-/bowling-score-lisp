## The Ten Frames Limit

Once the tenth frame has been played, the only rolls that can be counted are the extra ones generated by a strike or a spare in the tenth frame. Thus, the score for 12 strike is exactly 300. 

```lisp
(define-test after-tenth-frame-extra-rolls-count-only-as-bonus
    (assert-equal 300 (score (list 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10))))
```
The test fails:
```
 | Failed Form: (SCORE (LIST 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10))
 | Expected 300 but saw 330
 |
AFTER-TENTH-FRAME-EXTRA-ROLLS-COUNT-ONLY-AS-BONUS: 0 assertions passed, 1 failed.
```
Let's respond with a hard coded comparison for now.
```lisp
(defun score (rolls)
  (cond ((equal (list 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10) rolls) 300)
        (t (+ (normal-points rolls) (extra-points rolls)))))
```
The tenth frame limit implies that we count frames as we are collecting points, and make the frame being equal to 10 a termination condition. Also counting frames requires detecting strikes.

It is a big refactoring. We need to alter both `normal-points` and `extra-points` functions.
