# Trivial Cases

## A Todo List

These are the cases I can think of so far :

- simple, average rolls, not making bonus points
- bonus after a spare (two rolls adding up to 10)
- two rolls adding up to 10 don't necessarily make a spare
- bonuses after a strike
- several strikes in a row
- bonuses from the last frame
