# The Bowling Score Kata

The TDD method consists in creating capacities for the program one step at a time, following a cycle of 
- writing a failing test
- make the pass
- refactor

Our todo list for the Bowling Score Kata starts with simple cases and progressively adds features :
- averages games (no bonus points)
- strike roll on the first frame
- strike rolls on any frame
- spare on the frame
- spares on any frames
- tenth frame rule (only bonus rolls are counted)
