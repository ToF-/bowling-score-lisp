Welcome to the bowling score kata ! 

In this little book, we will learn how to code in Common Lisp with the Test Driven Development approach. We will be using the [Steel Bank Common Lisp](https://www.sbcl.org/) with the [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) library manager.

Programming the bowling score kata will allow us to discover the lisp language as well as the design steps in TDD.
