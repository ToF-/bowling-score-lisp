# The Bowling Score Kata in Lisp

Welcome to the Lisp Bowling Score Kata! 

In this little book, we learn how to code in Common Lisp applying Test Driven Development. 

We will be using the [Steel Bank Common Lisp](https://www/sbcl/org/) with as few external libraries as possible.

The Bowling Score Kata exercise is about writing a program that can compute scores at the Ten-Pin Bowling, given lists of rolls points made by players.
We start with setting up the simplest environment that will allow us to code this kata in Common Lisp.
