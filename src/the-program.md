## The Program

Our program, called `score` will process the standard input text flow, interpreting it as bowling game lists of rolls, and printing the computed score for each game.

Here's an session example: supposing we have a file named `sample.txt` containing the given text cases:

    3
    2
    4 6
    4
    10 7 3 5
    12
    10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10

then lauching our program with this input should print the following:
```bash
> score <sample.txt
10
40
300
```
